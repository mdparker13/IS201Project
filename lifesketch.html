                        <p>I was born in Portland, Oregon and am the second oldest of six children, with four brothers and one sister. I like to view my life by the places I have lived: Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Europe.
                         </p>
                        <p>I lived in Dallas, Texas, until I was eight years old. It was there that I began to love learning, because of my engaging and caring teachers. They instilled in me a love for learning by making our activities hands on and exciting. I was placed in an advanced class for math and science, and I loved the challenge of it.  I have fond memories of building protective cases for eggs and dropping them off the school roof, as well as engineering bridges out of popsicle sticks and competing to see whose was the strongest.
                        </p>
                        <p>Before third grade, I moved to Vienna, Virginia. Our house was about 20 minutes from Washington D.C., so I was immersed in some of the best historical and cultural landmarks our country has to offer. My family spent every weekend visiting various Smithsonians, monuments, battlegrounds, and government buildings. I learned many important life lessons while I was there. One of them was how to be a good leader. I served in the schoolâ€™s student council as secretary and through student council, we met a Virginia senator, took a tour of the capitol building, and observed a large meeting with state representatives. These experiences opened my eyes to jobs within our national government and started my interest in being a future government employee.
                        </p>
                        <p>I was devastated to leave my friends in Virginia, but quickly made friends in my new home, Spokane, Washington. I spent about 7 years there and during this time had many positions of leadership through school, church, and sports. I sought opportunities to serve, including when I worked with a program called Blessings Under the Bridge. Spokane has many people experiencing homelessness throughout our city. I gathered donated blankets and personally delivered them to those in need. It was a moving experience and it made me more grateful for the simple blessings in my life. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In 2021, I graduated from highschool and started my freshman year at Brigham Young University. In January 2022 I received my mission call, and in June of that same year I was set apart as a full time missionary serving in the Alpine German-Speaking Mission. I served in southern Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. I grew in my love for the gospel and my Savior Jesus Christ, and I learned how to be a better disciple of Christ as I served in different leadership roles. I was blessed to train three sisters on how to be diligent, obedient missionaries. I served as a sister training leader to the sisters in my zone, and I had the pleasure of opening two new areas and building them from the ground up. My mission was hard, but I loved every second of it. It was the difficulty that built me into the disciple of Christ I am today.
                        </p>
                        <p>In December 2023, I returned home from my mission, and I am excited and optimistic about the next chapter of my life!
